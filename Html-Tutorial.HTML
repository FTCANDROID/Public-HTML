headings--> Large text typically to advertise text
Example-h1,h2.h3
<h1> is the opening tag and </h1> is the closing tag. Put the text in between. Exempli Gratia: <h1> Guts and Blackpowder</h1> 
Repeat this for all heading types. 
Same thing with Normal Text---> <p> and </p>.
Lists are cool--> <ol> and </ol> for ordered lists and <ul> and </ul> for unordered lists. But every list item(like for example if your list was
a grocery list) has to be started with <li> and end with </li>
